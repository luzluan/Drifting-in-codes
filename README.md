🌌 Drifting in Codes

Drifting in Codes is a small, evolving Python project built in weekly increments.
It mixes exploration, logic, learning, and a little cosmic atmosphere — a space where I experiment, practice, and slowly expand my programming skills.

The goal isn’t speed.
The goal is movement — drifting, but in the right direction.

🚀 Project Concept

You play as a lone traveler drifting through space, managing:

resources (oxygen, energy, sanity?)

movement between sectors

random events and decisions

logs of your journey

(later) saving/loading progress

(optional) pulling real data from space APIs

The project grows each weekend, feature by feature.

🎯 Development Goals

Master Python fundamentals (lists, dicts, functions)

Learn file handling (saving progress in JSON)

Build modular code (splitting logic into clean files)

Add interactive features step-by-step

Optionally explore APIs and Flask in the future

🛠️ How to Run
python3 src/main.py

(Features will grow over time.)

📝 Notes

This project is more than practice — it’s a personal journey into consistent coding, creativity, and slow, steady improvement.

Every commit represents a tiny step forward.
